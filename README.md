qt-sample-scripts
=================

This repository holds an extension for the xTuple desktop client containing examples of what scripting can do.
The examples don't combine to form a complete feature but they show a number of key features:

- The recommended directory structure for an extension
- The format of the `package.xml` file
- How to open different kinds of window - QMainWindow, QDialog, and QWidget
- How to modify existing application windows
- How to create completely new windows for your extension
- How to use the XTreeWidget
- How to allow translation of your extension

and more.
